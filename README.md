# Real-time 3D modeling and immersion with Tangibles

We have paired GRASS GIS with Blender, a state-of-the-art 3D modeling
and rendering program, to allow real-time 3D rendering and immersion with Tangible Landscape. Tangible Landscape is a tangible interface for geographic information systems (GIS). It interactively couples physical and digital models of a landscape so that users can intuitively explore, model, and analyze geospatial data in a collaborative environment. Conceptually Tangible Landscape lets users hold a GIS in their hands so that they can feel the shape of the topography, naturally sculpt new landforms, and interact with simulations like water flow. As users manipulate a tangible model with topography and objects, geospatial analyses and simulations are projected onto the tangible model and perspective views are realistically rendered on monitors and head-mounted displays (HMDs) in near real-time. Users can visualize in near real-time the changes they are making with either bird’s-eye views or perspective views from human vantage points. While geospatial data is typically visualized as maps, axonometric views, or bird’s-eye views, human-scale perspective views help us to understand how people would experience and perceive spaces within the landscape.
